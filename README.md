This zip file contains segments of the code pertaining to Attack 1 and 2 in the paper Adversarial Machine Learning Threats to Spacecraft. The program has been stripped down to enable users without GPUs to execute the program, hence the singular target variables in the nominal GNC algorithm. 
The links to the datasets employed are provided as follows and will have to be manually installed to execute the programs: 

Attack 1: https://data.nasa.gov/Aerospace/Blue-Origin-Demo-of-Deorbit-Descent-and-Landing-Se/nj3a-8wq3/about_data
Attack 2: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10.html

Each of the Programs were run within NASA's cFS using NASA's OnAIR Platform.
